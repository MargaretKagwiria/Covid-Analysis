# COVID Data Analysis using SQL

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data from `CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` using SQL. One query was designed for exploratory analysis, while the other was crafted to manipulate data for visualization in Tableau.

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data related to deaths and vaccinations. Using SQL queries, we explore the datasets `CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccinations.xlsx`, to derive insights and prepare data for visualizations.

## Datasets
The project utilizes two main datasets:

`CovidDeaths.xlsx`: Contains information about COVID-related deaths including date, location, and death counts.
`CovidVaccinations`.xlsx: Provides data on COVID vaccinations including dates, regions, and vaccination counts.

## SQL Queries
Exploratory Analysis Query: `Covid_exploratory_analysis_SQLQuery.sql`
The exploratory analysis query examines the trends in COVID deaths and vaccinations, providing insights into temporal patterns, regional impacts, and other relevant statistics.

Data Manipulation for Tableau: `Covid_Tableau_SQLQuery.sql`
Describe the data transformation and preparation performed by the Tableau query, highlighting the structure and format suitable for visualization. Find the visualizations on the Tableau workbook uploaded `Covid_Analysis.tbwx`

## Usage
Ensure you have a SQL database or environment set up.
Import the datasets `CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` into your SQL database.
Run the provided SQL queries in your SQL environment.
Extract the results or modified datasets for further analysis or visualization in tools like Tableau.
Results
Outline the outcomes, insights, or potential visualizations generated from the queries to emphasize the significance of the analysis.
